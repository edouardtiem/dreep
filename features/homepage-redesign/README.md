# Feature: Homepage Redesign

Transform the Dreep homepage from wireframe-fidelity (5.3/10 design audit score) to a conversion-optimized, professional B2B SaaS landing page.

## Context

A design specialist audited the current homepage and identified 10 improvements ranked by conversion impact. The conceptual design (strikethrough objections, inaction ticker, tagline) is strong — the execution needs to match.

## What Works
- Cool zinc dark hero with radial indigo glow — feels premium
- Giant 56px live cost counter as visual centerpiece (red glow)
- Strikethrough objection animation is clever and on-brand
- Unified input container (Vercel-style) with inset branded CTA
- Staggered blur-in entrance choreography
- Floating "Dreep" wordmark — no navbar clutter
- Font pairing (Instrument Serif + DM Sans + JetBrains Mono)
- Step transition animations are polished
- Copy is tight and direct
- Trust line with | dividers (Gratuit | Sans inscription | 30 secondes)
- Mobile stepper is clean and informative
- "vous signez" draw-in underline (indigo, pen-stroke feel, single glow pulse)
