# DREEP — Product Requirements Document

## One-liner

Dreep lets B2B salespeople send a link to their prospects that shows them how much their problem costs — in euros, per week, month, quarter, and year — with a live counter.

## Problem

B2B deals die between calls, not during them. Salespeople blame prospects for ghosting, but the real issue is they never quantify the prospect's pain in money. The prospect doesn't feel urgency because no one showed them the number. They can't sell internally because they have no business case. The deal stalls and dies silently.

Training salespeople on discovery and pain quantification (MEDDPICC) doesn't scale. It's expensive, time-consuming, and most salespeople forget it after a week.

## Solution

A product that does the pain quantification FOR the salesperson. The salesperson pastes their website URL. Dreep scrapes it, understands what they sell, generates a diagnostic questionnaire. The salesperson tests it, validates it, gets a link. They send that link to prospects. The prospect answers 5-8 simple questions about THEIR situation and sees a visual, animated breakdown of what their problem costs them per year. With a real-time counter ticking while they read.

The salesperson never learns MEDDPICC. The product encodes it invisibly.

## Target User

- **Primary**: B2B salespeople and sales managers in France (MVP), then globally
- **Company size**: 10-500 employees
- **Current tools**: CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive), email, LinkedIn
- **Pain level**: Losing deals to "no budget" and ghosting

## Core Principles

1. **Zero friction** — The salesperson pastes a URL. That's the hardest thing they do.
2. **Value for the prospect** — The diagnostic is FOR the prospect. It helps them understand their own problem and sell internally.
3. **No education required** — Never mention MEDDPICC. Never explain methodology. The product teaches by usage.
4. **The product IS the distribution** — Every diagnostic sent = prospects and their colleagues see Dreep.

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Salesperson Onboarding (one-time, 3-4 minutes)

#### Screen 1 — Paste URL
- Single input field: "Votre site web"
- Button: "Analyser →"
- On click: loading animation (2-3 seconds), scrape the website

#### Screen 2 — Confirm Understanding
- Pre-filled text area with what Dreep understood:
  - What they sell
  - Who they sell to (persona)
  - Their key differentiator
  - Their target company size/industry
- The salesperson can edit/adjust
- Tip: "Ajoutez vos chiffres clés si vous en avez — ça rendra le diagnostic plus percutant"
- Buttons: "← Retour" / "C'est bon, on continue →"

#### Screen 3 — Test the Diagnostic
- Yellow banner: "Mettez-vous dans la peau de votre dernier prospect. Répondez comme il l'aurait fait."
- 5-8 questions generated by AI based on the business description
- Each question is a slider with min/max values and unit
- Under each question: "👎 Cette question sera claire pour votre prospect ?" → opens feedback field
- Questions should be:
  - Simple numbers the prospect knows (headcount, time spent, frequency, error rate...)
  - NOT opinion-based or subjective
  - Ordered from easiest to hardest
- Buttons: "← Retour" / "Voir le résultat →"

#### Screen 4 — See the Result
- Big animated number in red: "XXX XXX €" with count-up animation
- "par an" subtitle
- Bar chart with 4 bars: Semaine → Mois → Trimestre → Année
  - Bars animate in sequence (staggered)
  - Annual bar is red, others are dark
- Live drip counter: "Depuis que vous lisez : -X.XX €" (ticks every second)
- Expandable section: "Comment on arrive à ce chiffre" — transparent calculation breakdown
- Validation: "Ce résultat correspond à la réalité de votre prospect ?"
  - "👍 Oui, c'est crédible" → go to Screen 5
  - "👎 Non, ajuster" → back to Screen 3

#### Screen 5 — Link Ready
- Success state with checkmark
- Shareable link: `dreep.app/d/[unique-id]`

- 200 prospect links sent
- 40% prospect completion rate
- 10% prospect share rate

## Design Direction

- **Aesthetic**: Clean, minimal, professional. NOT playful, NOT enterprise-heavy.
- **Typography**: DM Sans for body, JetBrains Mono for numbers/data
- **Colors**: Slate/dark for primary, Red (#ef4444) for cost/urgency, Green for positive actions
- **Animations**: Smooth, purposeful. Bar chart stagger, counter tick, number count-up.
- **Tone of voice**: Direct, confident, no fluff. "Votre problème vous coûte X €." Not "Nous avons calculé que potentiellement votre problème pourrait coûter environ..."
- **Prospect page**: Neutral, credible, looks like a professional report. NOT a sales tool.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Question generation quality**: How good is AI at generating relevant, credible questions for any B2B business? Need to test with 10+ different businesses.
2. **Calculation credibility**: Will prospects trust the numbers? The transparency of the calculation is critical.
3. **One question per page vs all on one page**: Test both with real users.
4. **Email gate**: Should we ask for prospect's email before showing results? (Probably not for MVP — kills completion rate. But valuable for the salesperson.)
5. **Benchmarks**: Can we source reliable industry benchmarks to make calculations more credible? Or rely purely on prospect's self-reported numbers?

## References

- **Inspiration**: Calendly (simplicity + viral), Typeform (prospect experience), Loom (link sharing model)
- **Competitive landscape**: ROI calculators exist (Cuvama, ROI Shop, Ecosystems) but they're enterprise, expensive (30-50K€ setup), and require consulting. Dreep is self-serve, instant, and AI-generated.
